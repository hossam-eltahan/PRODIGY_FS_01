# Secure Authentication System

A secure authentication system designed to provide robust user authentication mechanisms, including secure password handling, user sessions, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Password Hashing:** Secure password storage using bcrypt or Argon2 hashing algorithms.
- **Session Management:** Safe and secure user sessions using cookies with secure flags.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Optional two-factor authentication for additional security.
- **Account Lockout:** Protection against brute-force attacks by locking accounts after multiple failed login attempts.
- **Input Validation:** Prevents common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Server-side scripting language for authentication logic.
- **MySQL:** Database for storing user credentials and session data.
- **Composer:** PHP dependency manager (if applicable).
- **JWT/Two-Factor Libraries:** Libraries for handling JSON Web Tokens or two-factor authentication (if applicable).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **PHP** (version 7.4 or higher)
- **MySQL** (version 5.7 or higher)
- **Composer** (for managing PHP dependencies)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
   cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**

   - Create a MySQL database (e.g., `auth_system`).
   - Import the provided SQL schema (`schema.sql`) to set up the required tables.

4. **Configure the application:**

   - Update database connection details in `config/config.php`.
   - Set up environment variables in `.env` file if used.

5. **Run the application:**

   - Start the PHP built-in server or configure it with Apache/Nginx.

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

## Usage

1. **Register an account** with a secure password.
2. **Log in** using your credentials.
3. **Enable two-factor authentication** for additional security (if applicable).
4. **Manage user sessions** and handle password resets as needed.

## Configuration

- **Password Hashing:** Configurable hashing algorithm in `config/auth.php`.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Configure 2FA options in `config/2fa.php`.
- **Session Management:** Configure session settings in `config/session.php`.
